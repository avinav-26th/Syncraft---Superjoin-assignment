# Syncraft ⚡️

**A Real-time, Two-Way Synchronization Engine between Google Sheets and a Custom Dashboard.**

Syncraft allows users to manage Google Sheets data from a modern, secure web interface. Changes made in the Dashboard reflect instantly in the Sheet, and edits in the Sheet appear immediately on the Dashboard—all while preserving data integrity and handling multi-user conflicts.

## 🚀 Key Features (The "Nuances" Handled)

1.  **Multiplayer Identity Injection**: Even when a user edits the Google Sheet directly, their email identity (`Session.getActiveUser()`) is captured and synced to the dashboard's audit log.
2.  **Concurrency Control**: Implements **Optimistic UI** updates and **Atomic SQL Transactions** (`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`) to prevent race conditions when multiple users edit the same row simultaneously.
3.  **Google Quota Management**: Uses a **Batch Processing Queue** in Apps Script to bundle rapid edits into single API calls, avoiding Google's 6-second execution limit.
4.  **Dynamic Schema Adaptation**: The backend automatically detects column changes in the Sheet and alters the MySQL schema on the fly—no manual migration scripts needed.
5.  **Secure Access**: Built with **NextAuth v5** (OAuth 2.0) and a strict Middleware "Bouncer" that restricts access to an allowed list of Admin emails.
6.  **Audit Trails**: A "Conflict Log" records the `prev_value` vs `new_value` for every change, ensuring complete data accountability.

## 🛠️ Engineering Challenges & Edge Cases Handling Details

Building a true 2-way sync involves handling race conditions, data type mismatches, and infrastructure timeouts. Below is a detailed log of the specific nuances and edge cases handled in this architecture.

### 1. The "Ghost Data" & Lazy Loading Problem
* **Challenge:** When a user creates a new sheet and makes a single edit, naive webhooks only send that single row. If the backend creates a table based on just that row, the rest of the existing data in the sheet is lost.
* **Solution:** Implemented a **"Smart Import" Logic**. The backend checks if the table exists and has data. If the table is missing or practically empty, the first webhook trigger forces a **Full Sheet Fetch** to populate the initial state. Subsequent edits switch to lightweight single-row `UPSERT` operations.

### 2. Infrastructure & "Cold" Connections
* **Challenge:** Cloud databases (like TiDB Serverless) sever idle connections after 5-10 minutes, causing `ECONNRESET` errors when the backend tries to sync after a period of inactivity.
* **Solution:** Implemented a **Database Heartbeat** mechanism that pings the database every 10 seconds to keep the connection pool active and "hot," ensuring instant response times for webhooks.

### 3. Schema Sanitization & "Double Prefixing"
* **Challenge:** SQL tables cannot have columns with spaces or special characters. We sanitize headers (e.g., `Market Value` → `col_market_value`). However, sending this back to the frontend sometimes resulted in recursive sanitization (e.g., `col_col_market_value`).
* **Solution:** Built a smart sanitizer that detects existing prefixes and prevents double-labeling. Additionally, the backend performs a "Fuzzy Match" lookup when writing back to Google Sheets, correctly mapping `col_model` in the DB to `Model` in the Sheet.

### 4. Batch Operations (Multiplayer Usage)
* **Challenge:** Standard Google Apps Script `onEdit` triggers often fail or only capture the top-left cell when a user pastes a large block of data (e.g., 50 rows at once).
* **Solution:** The Apps Script logic was upgraded to detect `range` height. If multiple rows are edited, it iterates through the range and sends a **Batch Payload** ensuring every single row in the paste operation is synced to the database.

### 5. Silent Failures & Security
* **Challenge:** Securely managing `service-account.json` keys in a production environment (Render) without committing them to Git.
* **Solution:** Utilized Render's **Secret Files** mount to securely inject credentials at runtime (`/etc/secrets/`), allowing the application to authenticate with Google APIs without exposing sensitive keys in the codebase.

### 6. Empty & Duplicate Headers
* **Challenge:** Users often leave columns blank or name them identically, which crashes SQL `CREATE TABLE` commands.
* **Solution:** The sync engine automatically assigns placeholder names (e.g., `Column_5`, `Column_6`) to unnamed headers. This ensures the SQL schema generation never fails, even with messy user data.

### 7. Granular Diff Tracking
* **Challenge:** In a high-frequency edit environment, it is difficult to visualize exactly what changed in a row with many columns.
* **Solution:** The history log captures both the `prev_value` and `new_value` states as JSON. The frontend uses this to calculate the difference, highlighting specific cell changes in the audit log rather than just showing a generic "Row Updated" message.

### 8. Port Collision & Environment Isolation
* **Challenge:** Running a full-stack Next.js app alongside an Express API locally often leads to port conflicts, especially when handling OAuth callbacks on `localhost:3000`.
* **Solution:** Engineered the architecture to run the Backend API strictly on **Port 5000** while keeping the Next.js Frontend on **Port 3000**. This isolation ensures that OAuth redirects and proxy rewrites function correctly without "Address already in use" errors during development.

## 🧠 Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

### 1. Why Webhooks + Smart Polling over WebSockets?
* **Decision:** We utilized Google Apps Script Webhooks for Sheet-to-DB sync and React Query "Smart Polling" for DB-to-Dashboard sync.
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Statelessness:** WebSockets require maintaining persistent stateful connections, which complicates horizontal scaling (serverless environments like Render often kill idle socket connections).
    * **Reliability:** Webhooks are retriable. If the server is down, the edit event isn't lost in a dropped socket connection; it can be logged or retried.
    * **Nature of Data:** Spreadsheet edits are human-speed events (seconds), not high-frequency trading (milliseconds). A 3-5 second poll interval provides a "perceived real-time" experience with significantly lower infrastructure complexity.

### 2. Why "Lazy Loading" (Snapshot vs. Stream)?
* **Decision:** The system does not import data immediately upon sheet creation. It waits for the first user edit to trigger a full snapshot import.
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Resource Efficiency:** Prevents the database from being flooded with stale or unused sheets. We only incur the cost of storage and processing for sheets that are actively being worked on.
    * **Performance:** Subsequent updates use lightweight `UPSERT` operations (single row payload) rather than re-scanning the entire sheet, ensuring O(1) performance for edits regardless of sheet size.

### 3. Handling Scale (100 Million Records)
* **Current implementation:**
    * **Server-Side Pagination:** The dashboard never fetches "all" data. It fetches chunks (`LIMIT 50 OFFSET X`), ensuring the frontend remains snappy even with million-row tables.
    * **Incremental Sync:** The sync engine processes only the *delta* (changes), never the full dataset after the initial load.
* **Future Scale Strategy:**
    * **Database Sharding:** For 100M+ records, we would shard the MySQL tables based on `sheet_id`.
    * **Queue-Based Ingestion:** Instead of processing webhooks synchronously (which might timeout on massive pastes), we would push events to a Redis Queue (BullMQ) and process them via background workers.

### 4. Authentication Strategy (Google Only)
* **Decision:** Restricted login to Google OAuth.
* **Reasoning:** Since the core integration target is Google Sheets, the user *must* have a Google identity. Implementing a separate Email/Password flow adds friction and security surface area without adding value to the core workflow.

### 5. Why a Standalone Dashboard vs. Spreadsheet Extension?
* **Decision:** Built a separate full-stack React application rather than an embedded Google Workspace Add-on.
* **Reasoning:**
    * **Control:** A standalone app offers complete control over the UI/UX rendering engine (React) without the limitations of Google's Apps Script HTML Service (CardService).
    * **Observability:** It decouples the "View" from the "Source." If Google Sheets goes down, the data remains accessible and queryable via the Dashboard.

### 6. Conflict Resolution & Audit History
* **Decision:** Implemented a `sync_history` table that logs `prev_value` and `new_value` for every cell change.
* **Reasoning:** In a 2-way sync system, "Last Write Wins" is the default strategy, but it is destructive. The history log acts as a safety net, allowing users to trace *who* overwrote data and roll back if necessary (a critical feature for multi-user environments).

## 🔮 Future Roadmap & Scalability

While the current MVP demonstrates a robust single-tenant architecture, the roadmap for Syncraft focuses on transitioning to a multi-tenant SaaS platform with enterprise-grade features.

### 1. Architecture Transition (SaaS Model)
* **Multi-Tenancy:** Migration from configuration-based setup (`.env`) to a relational metadata schema (`Users`, `Organizations`, `Projects`) allowing a single user to manage multiple distinct Sheet synchronizations.
* **Google Workspace Add-on:** Replacing the manual Apps Script deployment with a published **Workspace Add-on**. This will allow users to "Connect to Syncraft" directly from the Google Sheets sidebar, automatically provisioning webhooks and API keys.

### 2. Advanced User Management
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implementing granular permissions beyond the current binary Admin/No-Access model:
    * **Viewer:** Read-only access to dashboard data (for stakeholders).
    * **Editor:** Cell-level updates allowed; schema changes restricted.
    * **Owner:** Full control over project settings, user invites, and billing.
* **Organization-Level Admins:** Allowing "Super Admins" to invite team members via email and assign them to specific projects/sheets.

### 3. Data Integrity & Visualization
* **Type Enforcement Layer:** Unlike Google Sheets (which is loosely typed), the Dashboard will enforce strict data types (e.g., Currency, Date, Email, Select Dropdowns) during input, preventing "bad data" from corrupting the database.
* **Dynamic Views:** Leveraging the underlying data to offer alternative visualizations:
    * **Kanban View:** Automatically grouping rows by "Status" columns.
    * **Calendar View:** Visualizing rows based on "Date" columns.
    * **Form View:** Public-facing forms to allow external users to append rows without full table access.

### 4. UX & Performance
* **Theme Toggle:** Implementation of system-aware Dark/Light mode (UI scaffolding already present).
* **Virtualization:** Implementing `react-window` for the Data Table to support rendering 10,000+ rows with zero performance degradation.
* **Offline Mode:** PWA (Progressive Web App) support to allow dashboard edits while offline, syncing changes to the queue once connectivity is restored.
