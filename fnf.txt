1. only gets synced when the update is saved
2. if we select multiple rows or columns and then do some editing, it crashes
3. if we write something on an un-named column, it does not gets registered or anything, this is a major flaw
4. userA and userB mulitplayer mode enable
5. are we managing different sheets, or just a single sheet? how are we managing different sheets of a single spreadsheet document
6. fix the production-level bot allowance
7. figure out the entire auth flow and implement it
8. reading any changes only when saved, otherwise not
9. the list is not scrollable, give some toast that the data has been updated, and also make the ui a bit smaller, otherwise managing a very big data-table from our dashboard will become a UX nighmare, infact, the cell-edit text area becomes to wide
10. handle the race condition and also give a discarded data tab, so that the admin can decide what thing to actually discard, some important information should not be punished due to lww
11. add a manual refresh btn in our dashboard which will refersh the dashboard, basically again it will establish connection, just for extra sense of security to the user
12. we should make the table that it can be customisable, to how certain columns and rows only, and also add paginations and infinte scroll option
13. the table in our dashboard should be sortable, according to row number and last updated, both in increasig and decreasing order

14. changes: hard-coded localhost links to actual links, readme, description, deploy, publish, SS, video explanation, submit

15. add an option to make those google email ids as admin as well
